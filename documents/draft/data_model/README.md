# Collection Description Standard

## Introduction
This folder contains the definitions that are used in the data model.

## Data model
To describe the data model..

## Working on terms and definitions
In order to facilitate the working on the Collection Description standard, issues will be created on the different classes. Ongoing discussions on these classes should be held within these issues. In case a lot of discussion is needed on a specific term, a new issue on that term can be created. Typically, the changes on the data model can be pushed to the repository when an issue is resolved. Please make advantage of this system by assigning the issue to the correct people.

For each of the dimensions in the breakdown of the data model, a new project will be created (https://github.com/tdwg/cd/projects). We will use 'Data model - <dimension>' naming convention for each of the projects. Eqch issue will be added to the relevant project.
